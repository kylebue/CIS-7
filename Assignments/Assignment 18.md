1.	g(a) = (1,2)

	g(b) = (1,3)
	
	g(c) = (2,3)

2.	a)	Yes the graph is simple because there are no parallel looping 			sides

	b)	No the graph is not complete because you cannot connect any 		node with ever other node

	c)	Yes the graph is connected because you can get to a node from 		any other node using a path

	d)	Yes there are two paths from 3 to 6 ([3->4->5->6], 					[3->5->6])

	e)	Yes there are cycles in the graph (ex. [3->4->5->3])

	f)	Yes, if you remove a5, there are no more cycles

	g)	Yes you can remove a few arcs to make the graph not connected 		(ex. a2, a6)
