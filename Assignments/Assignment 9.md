Assignment 9 Answers:

###1. 	Prove by induction that 1 + 5 + 9 + ... + (4n-3) = n(2n-1)

		n=1
		
		1 = 1(2(1) - 1)
		
		1 = 1(2-1)
		
		1 = 1(1)
		
		1 = 2-1
		
		Base case is true.

		k(2k-1) + (4(k+1)-3) = (k+1)(2(k+1)-1)
		
		(2k^2-k) + (4k+4-3) = (k+1)(2k+2-1)
		
		2k^2-k+4k+1 = (k+1)(2k+1)
		
		2k^2+3k+1 = 2k^2+k+2k+1
		
		Answer: 2k^2+3k+1 = 2k^2+3k+1
