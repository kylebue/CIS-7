Assignment 9 Answers:

1. 	Prove by induction that 1 + 5 + 9 + ... + (4n-3) = n(2n-1)

	n=1
	
	(4(1) - 3) = 1(2(1) - 1)
	
	4-3 = 1(2-1)
	
	1 = 1(1)
	
	1 = 2-1
	
	Base case is true.

	1 + 5 + 9 + ... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)(2(k+1)-1)
	
	4(k+1) - 3 = k(2k-1)
	
	4k + 4 - 3 = 2k^2 - k
	
	4k + 1 = 2k^2 + k + 2k + 1
	
	4k + 1 = 2k^2 + 3k + 1
