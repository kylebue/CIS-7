 #37:
 
 #38: No it does not because (A^B)' will actually equal false if A and B are both true and therefore not execute statement 1 when wanted
 
 #61: Percival has to be a truth teller because if he is a liar, then he would be telling the truth by his statement, "At least one of us is a liar" because he would be talking about himself which makes at least one liar which is a true statement that he cannot make if he is a liar. This is a contradiction and therefore Percival must be a truth teller. Llewellyn is a liar because that's the only way Percival's statement could be true.
 
 #62: They both have to be truth tellers. If Merlin is a liar, then his statement needed to be false, but it could still be true even if he lied because Meredith could still be a truth teller even if Merlin is a liar which is a contradiction.
 
 #63: They both have to be truth tellers because if Rothwold is a liar, there would be a contradiction in is statement where he would be telling the truth when he says he is a liar because liars always have to lie. The only way for the statement to make sense is if they are both truth tellers.

 #64: Testing push
