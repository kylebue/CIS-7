 #35: if ((7.2 < 5.0) && (14.4 < 10.7)) || (6 > 5.1)
 T 1.0
 F
 T 2.4
 T 7.2
 T 5.3
 
 ANSWER: 1.0, 2.4, 7.2, 5.3
 
 #37: if !(Value1 < Value2)
		statement1
	  else
		statement2
 
 #38: No it does not because (A^B)' will actually equal false if A and B are both true and therefore not execute statement 1 when wanted
 
 #61: Percival has to be a truth teller because if he is a liar, then he would be telling the truth by his statement, "At least one of us is a liar" because he would be talking about himself which makes at least one liar which is a true statement that he cannot make if he is a liar. This is a contradiction and therefore Percival must be a truth teller. Llewellyn is a liar because that's the only way Percival's statement could be true.
 
 #62: They both have to be truth tellers. If Merlin is a liar, then his statement needed to be false, but it could still be true even if he lied because Meredith could still be a truth teller even if Merlin is a liar which is a contradiction.
 
 #63: They both have to be truth tellers because if Rothwold is a liar, there would be a contradiction in is statement where he would be telling the truth when he says he is a liar because liars always have to lie. The only way for the statement to make sense is if they are both truth tellers.

 #64: A^B
		A  B  A^B
		T  T  T
		T  F  F
		F  T  F
		F  F  F
	  They both must be liars. Gwendolin must be a liar because he is calling himself a liar. If he was a truthteller, that would be a contradiction because truthtellers cannot lie and they can't be a liar and a truthteller at the same time. Therefore, Merrilaine must be a liar as well because if Gwendolin said Merrilaine isn't a liar, but she's lying about that, then that must make Merrilaine a liar as well.
